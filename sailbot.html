									<h3 class="major">Project Overview</h3>
									<p> Our student design team was working on an 18 ft autonomous sailbot to travel from Vancouver, BC to Maui, HI. As part of the team,
										I have had a chance to work on various electro-mechanical systems and software development as we prepare the boat for launch.
									</p>
									
									<p>
										The team was also working on our next project, a vessel for data collection for research applications. For this project, I was working on
										on the network systems of our boat. 
									</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Network Systems</h3>
									<p>
										For our next vessel, we are continuing to use <strong>ROS</strong> to communicate across various software modules on the boat.
										I was working towards implementing solutions for recieving data a sensor on the boat, parsing this data
										and then forwarding the information to other parts of our ROS network. 
									</p>

									<p>
										My work with the network systems team has given me a better understanding of how CAN greatly simplified communication between distributed
										computers within a system. I have also learned more about the ROS framework and how it can be used to speed up development of complex systems.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Rudder System</h3>

									<p>
										The rudder system consists of 2 motors, 2 motor controllers, the rudders themselves, microcontrollers and rotary encoders.
										The rudders of the boat work in combination with the sails to control the direction of the boat. I worked on the implementation of the rudder acutation control 
										in <strong>C</strong> on an <strong> STM 32 based microcontroller</strong> that is running a <strong>Real Time OS - ChibiOS</strong>. 
										The boat employs <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus">CAN</a></strong> 
										to communicate across systems. The rudder recieves an angular position via CAN and engages the motor to reach the position, as defined by the rotoary encoder. 
										I implemented a <strong>PID</strong> acutation algorithm that achieved <strong>20%</strong> greater angular accuracy, matched the speed of the two rudders 
										and increased overall speed by <strong>15%</strong>.
