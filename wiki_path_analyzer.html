									<h3 class="major">Project Overview</h3>
									<p> In this <strong>Java</strong> project, I worked with with 2 team members to develop a mediator service for wikipedia, along with 
										a server application to interface with the mediator. The mediator service included functionality to get Wikipedia pages,
										cache pages to minimize API calls and store history of requests. The most challenging functionality was a feature 
										for the mediator to find the shortest path using links between two Wikipedia pages, effectively solving the
										<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game'>Wiki Game.</a>.
									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Server</h3>
									<p>
										To implement a server for users to intergace with our mediator service, our team implemented serveral thread safe methods
										to account for multithreaded behaviour when multiple users try to connect to the server. This involved writing
										several blocking and locking functions as well as working with synchronized methods with shared memory objects.

									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Shortest Path Processing</h3>

									<p>To find the shortest path between two wikipedia pages, we implmented a bread first search algorithm that would query the various links
										present on a wikipedia page. We treated each wikipedia page as a node on a directed graph with directed edges to pages linking
										to the page as well as pages linked by the page.
