									<h3 class="major">Project Overview</h3>
									<p>In building this project, I learned about machine learning, computer vision and using Linux. 
										The objective of the competition was to navigate the <strong>Gazebo</strong> simulation environment autonmously while reading the license plates of nearby vehicles,
										waiting at pedestrian crossings, and avoiding another moving vehicle. I worked with <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/long-phung/'> Mark Long </a> to develop our solution which resulted in a 2nd Place Finish, 
										with <strong>0</strong> off course traversal, <strong>11/12</strong> license plates accurately read and <strong>1 min 46 s</strong> total track time (fastest completion). 
									</p>
									
									<!-- add driving video-->
									
									<p>
										Our solution was developed in 2 separate modules, driving and plate detection, outlined in sections below. For communication between modules and software architecture, we employed ROS, 
										a robotics framework commonly used by researachers to speed up development. Our ROS network is seen below.

									<h3 class="major">Plate Detection</h3>
									<p>
										To detect license plates, we also used computer vision techniques and the <strong>Python OpenCV</strong> library. To identify the characters on the license plates
										as well as the relevant car, we developed <strong> Convolutional Neural Networks </strong> using the <strong> Keras </strong> library. To train 
										our CNNs, we developed a <strong>bash scripting</strong> solution for automated data collection from the simulated environment. <strong>Google Colab</strong>
										was an essential tool for development and testing of our networks.

									<h3 class="major">Driving</h3>
									<p>For driving, we used classical computer vision techniques. This included contour detection, PID line following, with heavy use of 
										the <strong>Python OpenCV</strong> library. 
										We also implemented a <strong>state machine</strong> to define the state of the rover at all times.</p>
